# Changelog

## 3.1.1

### New features

- **Local POM file support** -- `jgo list` and `jgo tree` now support local POM file paths.
- **More flexible `javainfo` subcommand** -- The `jgo info javainfo` command now accepts a list of arguments, each of which can be a Maven coordinate, a POM file or directory containing such, a JAR file, a class file, or a directory to scan recursively for such files. Each argument is analyzed and reported upon, and finally a summary is issued.

### Bug fixes

- **Sort `info versions` output** -- The reported versions list is now ordered according to Maven's versioning semantics.
- **Add missing type hints** -- The CLI layer's click-related functions now have full type hints.

## 3.1.0

### New features

- **`jar_java_version(artifact)`** -- Public helper in `jgo.env` returning the minimum Java version required by a resolved artifact's JAR. Results are memoized in-process and cached on disk (keyed by SHA-256) in a dedicated cache, separate from the JPMS metadata cache, so callers that only need a Java version can reuse jgo's bytecode analysis without re-scanning JARs or affecting environment-building classification.

### Bug fixes

- **`Model` inherits profile constraints from its context's resolver** -- A `Model` constructed directly (rather than via the resolver) with no explicit `profile_constraints` now falls back to those carried by `context.resolver`. The default `PythonResolver` auto-detects the host's OS properties, so directly-built models once again activate OS-conditional profiles. Previously such models left `profile_constraints` as `None`, skipping OS-property injection entirely -- platform-specific profiles never activated and their properties (e.g. `${scijava.natives.classifier.javacpp}`) stayed uninterpolated, producing GACT key collision warnings.

## 3.0.0

### Breaking changes

- **CLI is now an optional extra** -- The command-line tool's dependencies (rich, click, rich-click) are no longer installed by default. Use `pip install jgo[cli]` to include them. Plain `pip install jgo` gives you the Python library only.

- **Removed deprecated jgo 1.x API** -- The following, deprecated since 2.0.0, are gone:
  - `jgo.main()`, `jgo.main_from_endpoint()`, `jgo.resolve_dependencies()` -- use `jgo.run()`, `jgo.build()`, `jgo.resolve()` instead
  - `jgo/jgo.py` compatibility shim and `jgo.util.compat` module
  - Deprecated CLI flags (`-U`/`--force-update`, `-a`/`--additional-jars`, `--additional-endpoints`, `--link-type`, `--log-level`)

### New features

- **Maven metadata TTL cache** -- `Project.update(max_age=N)` skips HTTP fetches for metadata files younger than N seconds, reducing unnecessary network traffic.

- **Rate-limit handling** -- HTTP 429 and 529 responses are retried automatically, honoring `Retry-After` headers.

- **`Artifact.last_modified()`** -- Returns the deployment timestamp from the remote repository. Handles Nexus v3 correctly by using its REST API when the standard `Last-Modified` header would give the wrong value.

- **PEP 561 compliance** -- Added `py.typed` marker so downstream type checkers recognize jgo's inline type annotations.

---

## 2.2.0

### New features

- **`JavaSource.DOWNLOAD` mode** -- Forces a fresh JDK download via cjdk, bypassing any cached or system Java. Useful for reproducible CI environments.

---

## 2.1.3

### Bug fixes

- **Maven `relativePath` handling removed** -- Resolving POMs with `<relativePath>` entries caused incorrect resolution in some cases; the field is now ignored during resolution, matching Maven's behavior for remote artifacts.

---

## 2.1.2

### Improvements

- **Auto Java mode tuning** -- Improved heuristics for selecting a system Java vs. downloading one via cjdk, with clearer logging when the decision is made.

---

## 2.1.1

### Bug fixes

- **Windows path normalization** -- Metadata URL paths were constructed with backslashes on Windows, causing HTTP 404s. Now normalized to forward slashes.

- **`RELEASE` version resolution** -- Fixed incorrect resolution of the `RELEASE` pseudo-version in some repository configurations.

### Other changes

- Require Python 3.10+.

---

## 2.1.0

### New features

- **Custom resolver injection** -- `jgo.build()` now accepts a `resolver=` argument, letting callers supply their own `Resolver` instance instead of constructing one internally.

### Bug fixes

- **Platform auto-detection** -- `None` platform values are now resolved to the current platform rather than propagated as null, fixing profile activation on some systems.

---

## 2.0.1

### Bug fixes

- **Exclusions not applied** -- Exclusions declared in `jgo.toml` were parsed but silently ignored during resolution. They are now correctly applied.

- **`jgo.toml` validation** -- Basic structure validation is now performed when loading a spec file, giving a clear error on malformed input instead of a confusing traceback.

---

## 2.0.0

jgo 2 is a major rewrite with a new architecture, new CLI, and new Python API. It tries to maintain backward compatibility with jgo 1.x -- existing scripts and code should continue to work with deprecation warnings.

### New features

- **Command-based CLI** -- Modern subcommand interface (`jgo run`, `jgo init`, `jgo add`, `jgo list`, `jgo tree`, `jgo info`, `jgo search`, `jgo config`, etc.) following conventions from tools like `uv`, `cargo`, and `npm`. The `jgo <endpoint>` shorthand syntax still works.

- **jgo.toml project files** -- Reproducible environments with lock files, similar to `package.json` + `package-lock.json`. Create with `jgo init`, manage with `jgo add`/`jgo remove`, sync with `jgo sync`.

- **Pure Python dependency resolver** -- Resolve Maven dependencies without a Maven installation. Handles transitive dependencies, property interpolation, dependency management (BOMs), exclusions, and scopes.

- **Automatic Java management** -- Zero-configuration execution: jgo detects the minimum Java version from bytecode and downloads it on demand via [cjdk](https://github.com/cachedjdk/cjdk).

- **Three-layer architecture** -- Independently useful layers for Maven resolution (`jgo.maven`), environment materialization (`jgo.env`), and Java execution (`jgo.exec`).

- **High-level Python API** -- `jgo.run()`, `jgo.build()`, `jgo.resolve()` for simple programmatic usage.

- **Artifact search** -- `jgo search` queries Maven Central (and configured repositories) for artifacts.

- **Rich terminal output** -- Color, progress bars, and formatted tables via [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

- **JVM tuning flags** -- `--max-heap`, `--min-heap`, `--gc` for convenient JVM configuration.

- **Platform-aware profile activation** -- `--platform`, `--os-name`, `--os-arch` flags for Maven profile activation.

- **XDG config support** -- Settings file at `~/.config/jgo.conf` (XDG standard), with `~/.jgorc` still supported for backward compatibility.

### Breaking changes

- **Default cache directory** changed from `~/.jgo` to `~/.cache/jgo`. Override with `--cache-dir` or `JGO_CACHE_DIR`.
- **`-u` flag behavior** -- Now checks remote repositories (the old `-U` behavior). For the old `-u` behavior (local rebuild only), use `-u --offline`.

### Deprecated

- `jgo.main()`, `jgo.main_from_endpoint()`, `jgo.resolve_dependencies()` -- use `jgo.run()`, `jgo.build()`, `jgo.resolve()` instead.
- `-U`/`--force-update`, `-a`/`--additional-jars`, `--additional-endpoints`, `--link-type`, `--log-level` flags -- see {doc}`migration` for replacements.

Deprecated APIs were removed in jgo 3.0.
