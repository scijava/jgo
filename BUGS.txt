Components targeting Java 9+ may have split jars/ and modules/ (or often all modules/), so commands like `jgo info classpath` no longer work as desired, since there are few/no jars on the classpath. How should we handle this? Should we add `jgo info module-path`, or should we make `jgo info classpath` show information about both module-path and classpath sides? Example:
```
jgo -v info classpath org.scijava:scijava-ops-image:1.0.0
No JARs in classpath
```

Remove or repurpose obsolete files in docs/

Review all print commands -- which ones should be using _log instead?

Decide about remaining `~/.jgorc` references throughout the codebase

No API for managing jgo entrypoints

Do we still need --module-path-only flag?
- I lean toward yes, for symmetry, better PoLA adherence, and fail-fast when JAR(s) are non-modularizable.

What is the difference between `jgo -u` and `jgo update`? Do we need both?
- For non-project mode, `jgo -u` seems needed for whether to update hashed env...

pom-scijava bug: java3d-core 1.7.2 depends on gluegen-rt-main and jogl-all-main, and java3d-utils depends on joal-main; the `-main` artifacts each bring in *all* platform JARs :-(
