jgo.cli.subcommands -> jgo.cli.commands (can we really parcel out *all* of commands.py?)

Remove or repurpose obsolete files in docs/

Use consistent capitalization style for Markdown docs (excepting README.md and AGENTS.md, of course).

FIX PythonResolver bugs!
- Migrate thicket code from db-xml-maven

Reconcile jgo.toml, jgo.lock.toml, manifest.json in jgo envs -- do we really need manifest.json?
- Is jgo.toml in `./` always the same as the one in `./.jgo/<groupId>/<artifactId>/<hash>/` ?

Do we really need the `<groupId>/<artifactId>/<hash>` substructure beneath `.jgo` for workspace-based jgo?
- Nicer would be to mutate the env directly under the `cache_dir`. Do we need a toml flag for controlling this?

Add support for module paths

Shore up "jgorc" references throughout the codebase. `--ignore-jgorc` -> `--ignore-config`

Does `-vvv` (or a sufficient number of v's) pass `-X` to `mvn` when using the MvnResolver?

Make verbose flags give more dependency resolution detail:
- `jgo -v update` gives some info
- But it does not say what the newest version of each dep is, nor which deps got updated.

No API for managing jgo entrypoints

Terms `endpoint` and `entrypoint` are confusingly similar -- any recourse, or no?

What is the difference between `jgo -u` and `jgo update`? Do we need both?
- For non-project mode, `jgo -u` seems needed for whether to update hashed env...
